# K-means
`r Sys.Date()` updated  

K-means clustering: It is a method to cluster n points into k clusters based on the means of shortest distance. (cautsion: do not confused it with K-nearest clustering)

```{r}
# use kmeans from stats package
x <- rbind(matrix(rnorm(100, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2),
           matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2))
colnames(x) <- c("x", "y")
(cl <- kmeans(x, 2))
```

There are 7 Avaliable components you can access it.    
Plot the clustering result
```{r}
plot(x, col=cl$cluster)
#points(cl$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8, cex=2)
points(cl$centers, col = c("blue", "green"), pch=8, cex=2)
```
