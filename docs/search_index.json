A is usually the “current version” and B is often the “improved version”. 2.1 Scenario For someone who wants to test new feature on product. A: Offer ends this Saturday! Please use promotion code A B: The offer is about to end, please use promotion code B Send these message to a population and see which one get more clicks or sell more products. For a more persuasive result, a statistical test should be used to test if it is a significant result. 2.2 Case study ref In short, we want to test two variant design on a hotel booking website.

Hence, variant B is better than A by 82.72%. * For this analysis P-value computed was 0.02448. Hence, there is strong statistical significance in test results. * From the above results that depict strong statistical significance. You should reject the null hypothesis and proceed with the launch. * Therefore, Accept Variant B and you can roll it to the users for 100%. Limitations It is one of the tools for conversion optimization and it’s not an independent solution and it’s not going to fix all the conversion issues of ours and it can’t fix the issues as you get with messy data and you need to perform more than just an A/B test to improve on conversions.
