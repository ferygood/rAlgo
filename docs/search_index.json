A is usually the “current version” and B is often the “improved version”. 2.1 Scenario For someone who wants to test new feature on product. A: Offer ends this Saturday! Please use promotion code A B: The offer is about to end, please use promotion code B Send these message to a population and see which one get more clicks or sell more products. For a more persuasive result, a statistical test should be used to test if it is a significant result. 2.2 Case study ref In short, we want to test two variant design on a hotel booking website.

Hence, variant B is better than A by 82.72%. * For this analysis P-value computed was 0.02448. Hence, there is strong statistical significance in test results. * From the above results that depict strong statistical significance. You should reject the null hypothesis and proceed with the launch. * Therefore, Accept Variant B and you can roll it to the users for 100%. Limitations It is one of the tools for conversion optimization and it’s not an independent solution and it’s not going to fix all the conversion issues of ours and it can’t fix the issues as you get with messy data and you need to perform more than just an A/B test to improve on conversions.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
